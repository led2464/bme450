## Project description

## Max Â½ page. Include some information on:

- what dataset you plan to use

- goal of the project.


## IDEAS :D
- "Social media scraper that evaluates public opinion on (TOPIC)" (Tyler says we can do this in 100 lines of code supposedly)
- ECG interpreter :D (this is my senior design project, sorry Raiyana)
- Tool to diagnose diseases from imaging
  what if we did an X-ray interpreter to diagnose broken bones, this seems pretty easy but idk the purpose of such

- diagnosing disease (COVID?) based on audio data (coughing?) (EMBS project -- needed to sign NDA to access dataset so if we could find publicly available one that could be cool
