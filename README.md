## Project description

Mammograms are X-ray images of breast tissue commonly used to diagnose patients with breast cancer. We plan to use CBIS-DDSM: Breast Cancer Image Dataset to train our neural network to identify cancerous breast tissue masses using mammogram image data. We will incorporate convolutional neural networks to pull image characteristics from the dataset to determine if the tumor is benign or malignant.
